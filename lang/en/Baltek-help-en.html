        <h1>Interface</h1>
            <p>Hereafter are a few breve explanations on how to play moves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../../pictures/scores-and-bonuses.png" />
						display the scores and the availibility of the sprint bonuses
                        for the two players.</li>

                    <li><img src="../../pictures/credits.png" />
                        displays the credits of the active player.</li>

                    <li><img src="../../pictures/confirm-and-cancel-buttons.png" />
                        confirms or cancels/reinitializes the turn of the active player.</li>

                    <li><img src="../../pictures/sprint-button.png" />

                    <li>Unselect the selected footballer/ball prior
                        to go on for a new selection.</li>
                </ul>


        <h1>Playing modes</h1>

            <p>Hereafter are the playing modes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The two local players share the same Web browser.</li>
                    <li>Each of the two remote players uses his/her own Web browser.</li>
                    <li>The human player plays against an artifitial intelligence  (AI).</li>
                    <li>Two AI play against each other.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Only the mode <q>two local players</q> is implemented
                even if the bouton <q>New game</q> is coming together with the selector <q>Human/AI ...</q>.</p>


        <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>Access the rules via the button <q>Rules</q>.</p>


        <h1>Portability</h1>
            <p>BALTEK is played within a Web browser, and so is relatively portable.
               However, its current ergonomy requires a big enough screen and a mouse.</p>

            <p>The adaptation of BALTEK to smartphone is foreseen in a next phase.</p>
