## Introduction

This project, named **baltek-the-program**,  implements the BALTEK board game, using **HTML** and **JavaScript**.

BALTEK is a turn-based board game, inspired from **football**. Here are its principles:

- Game easily made by hand,
- defined by a few rules,
- without randomizing device.
- The game allows several actions per turn.
- The ball moves faster than the footballers.
- The coordination of footballers is essential.

The name of the game is built using sounds of the words ball (BAL) and technical (TEK).

The **atmosphere** of the matches is reminiscent of the game of **chess**.

## Usage

## History

During year 2015, the rules of the game have been tested within the limited circle of my family and office colleagues. The rules have been found balanced and fun.

Such tests were performed using handcrafted material (paper sheet and wooden pieces). See also the [pictures](http://lucas.borboleta.blog.free.fr/public/Baltek/2016-01--Baltek-Prototype-2/Diaporama.htm) from the blog [Lucas Borboleta](http://lucas.borboleta.blog.free.fr).

By end of year 2015, a software prototype has been started, but with a slow rhythm. I used this project for learning about JavaScript and improving my skills in software design and automated testing. 

Since Summer 2017, the full rules have been implemented and two humans sitting in front of the same computer can play a BALTEK match.

During Fall 2017, the effort was on translating of the rules text and selection of licenses.

In October 2017, the description of the **rules** was moved in a separate project, named  **[baltek-the-rules](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/baltek-the-rules)** in order to finalize their translations and to promote them.

In March 2018, two browsers can be synchronized thanks to [TogetherJS](https://togetherjs.com/) in order to realize the mode "two remote BALTEK players".
