# Introduction

This project is an HTML and JavaScript implementation of the BALTEK board game.

BALTEK is a turn-based board game, inspired from football, which relies on the following principles:

- game easily made by hand,

- with a few rules,

- without randomizing device,

- with several actions per turn.

- The ball moves faster than the footballers.

- The coordination of footballers is essential.

The name of the game is built with "ball" (BAL) and "technical" (TEK) sounds.

## Rules of Baltek

During year 2015, the rules of the game have been tested within the limited circle of my family and office colleagues. The rules have been found balanced and fun.

Such tests were performed using handcrafted material (paper sheet and wooden pieces). See also the [pictures](http://lucas.borboleta.blog.free.fr/public/Baltek/2016-01--Baltek-Prototype-2/Diaporama.htm) from the blog [Lucas Borboleta](http://lucas.borboleta.blog.free.fr)

Right now the rules are only written in French. I would like them to be translated in English, Esperanto and Portuguese. For such translations, I would appreciate contributions. Rules can be found in [./lang/fr](./lang/fr/LucasBorboleta_Baltek--fr--Jeu-de-football-tactique_LB_2015-1129-1050.pdf) or at <http://lucas.borboleta.blog.free.fr/>.

## Software implementation

By end of year 2015, a software prototype has been started, but with a slow rhythm. I used this project for learning about JavaScript and improving my skills in software design and automated testing. So I would like to move alone on a working branch until the game becomes useable. When this point will be reached, then the code will be merged on _master_ branch, and I will appreciate contributions. Well, this is my current vision by now.
