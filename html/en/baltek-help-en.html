        <h1>Interface</h1>
            <p>Hereafter are a few explanations on how to play moves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../../pictures/scores-and-bonuses.png" />
						display the scores and the availability of the sprint bonuses
                        for the two players.</li>

                    <li><img src="../../pictures/credits.png" />
                        displays the credits of the active player.</li>

                    <li><img src="../../pictures/confirm-and-cancel-buttons-en.png" />
                        confirms or cancels/reinitializes the turn of the active player.</li>

                    <li><img src="../../pictures/sprint-button-en.png" />
                        selects the sprint bonus.</li>

                    <li>Unselect the selected footballer/ball prior
                        to go on for a new selection.</li>
                </ul>


        <h1>Playing modes</h1>

            <p>Here are the playing modes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The two close players share the same Web browser.</li>
                    <li>Each of the two remote players uses his/her own Web browser.</li>
                    <li>The human player plays against an artificial intelligence (AI).</li>
                    <li>Two AI play against each other.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Only the <q>two close players</q> mode is currently implemented even if
               the <q>Human / IA ...</q> selector is displayed next to the <q>New Game</q> button.</p>


        <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>Access the rules via the button <q>Rules</q>.</p>


        <h1>Portability</h1>
            <p>BALTEK is played within a Web browser, and so is relatively portable.
               However, its current ergonomics requires a big enough screen and a mouse.</p>

            <p>The adaptation of BALTEK to smartphone is foreseen in another phase.</p>
