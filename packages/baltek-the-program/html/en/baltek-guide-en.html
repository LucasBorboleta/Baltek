    <h1>Interface</h1>

    <p>Hereafter are a few explanations on how to play moves:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <img alt="scores-and-bonuses" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/scores-and-bonuses.png" />
            display the scores and the availability of the sprint bonuses for the two players.
        </li>

        <li>
            <img alt="credits" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/credits.png" />
            displays the credits of the active player.
        </li>

        <li>
            <img alt="confirm-and-cancel-buttons-en" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/confirm-and-cancel-buttons-en.png" />
            confirms or cancels/reinitializes the turn of the active player.
        </li>

        <li>
            <img alt="sprint-button-en" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/sprint-button-en.png" />
            selects the sprint bonus.
        </li>

        <li>
            <img alt="can-kick" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/can-kick.png" />
            displays the capacity to shoot during the turn.
        </li>

        <li>
            <img alt="can-run" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/can-run.png" />
            displays the capacity to run during the turn.
        </li>

        <li>
            <img alt="can-kick-and-run" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/can-kick-and-run.png" />
            displays the capacities to shoot and run during the turn.
        </li>

        <li>Unselect the selected footballer/ball prior to go on for a new selection.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Settings</h1>

    <p>
        <img alt="settings" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/settings-en.png" />
        is used to select the playing mode, language, etc.
    </p>

    <p>Here are the playing modes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The two close players share the same Web browser.</li>
        <li>Each of the two remote players uses his/her own Web browser.</li>
        <li>The human player plays against an artificial intelligence (AI).</li>
        <li>Two AI play against each other.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Modes with AI are not yet implemented.</p>
    <h1>Invitation</h1>

    <div class="w3-row">
        <div class="w3-col m10">
            <p>
                <img alt="invitation" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/invitation-en.png" />
                shows or hides the <q>TogetherJS</q> interface that allows you to invite a remote friend to play BALTEK.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <q>TogetherJS</q> interface allows two remote players to synchronize their web browsers and also to chat.
            </p>

            <p>The <q>TogetherJS</q> interface provides help in English. Click on the avatar.</p>

            <p>
                Synchronize the two web browsers before starting a new game.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both players must apply themselves the rule of alternating turns,
                because the passive player's web browser is never blocked.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-col m2 w3-container">
            <div class="w3-card">
                <div class="w3-container">
                    <p>TogetherJS</p>
                </div>
                <img class="w3-image" alt="togetherjs-panel-en" src="../../../../packages/baltek-the-program/pictures/togetherjs-panel-en.png" />
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Rules</h1>

    <p>Access the rules via the button <q>Rules</q>.</p>

    <h1>Portability</h1>

    <p>
        BALTEK is played within a Web browser, and so is relatively portable.
        However,
        its current ergonomics requires a big enough screen and a mouse.
    </p>

    <p>The adaptation of BALTEK to smartphone is foreseen in another phase.</p>
