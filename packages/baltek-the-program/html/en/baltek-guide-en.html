    <h1>Interface</h1>
    <p>Hereafter are a few explanations on how to play moves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <img alt="scores-and-bonuses" src="../../pictures/scores-and-bonuses.png" /> display the scores and the availability of the sprint bonuses for the two players.</li>

        <li>
            <img alt="credits" src="../../pictures/credits.png" /> displays the credits of the active player.</li>

        <li>
            <img alt="confirm-and-cancel-buttons-en" src="../../pictures/confirm-and-cancel-buttons-en.png" /> confirms or cancels/reinitializes the turn of the active player.</li>

        <li>
            <img alt="sprint-button-en" src="../../pictures/sprint-button-en.png" /> selects the sprint bonus.</li>

        <li>
            <img alt="can-kick" src="../../pictures/can-kick.png" /> displays the capacity to shoot during the turn.</li>

        <li>
            <img alt="can-run" src="../../pictures/can-run.png" /> displays the capacity to run during the turn.</li>

        <li>
            <img alt="can-kick-and-run" src="../../pictures/can-kick-and-run.png" /> displays the capacities to shoot and run during the turn.</li>

        <li>Unselect the selected footballer/ball prior to go on for a new selection.</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Playing modes</h1>

    <p>Here are the playing modes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The two close players share the same Web browser.</li>
        <li>Each of the two remote players uses his/her own Web browser.</li>
        <li>The human player plays against an artificial intelligence (AI).</li>
        <li>Two AI play against each other.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Only the
        <q>two close players</q> mode is currently implemented even if the
        <q>Human / IA ...</q> selector is displayed next to the
        <q>New Game</q> button.</p>


    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>Access the rules via the button
        <q>Rules</q>.</p>


    <h1>Portability</h1>
    <p>BALTEK is played within a Web browser, and so is relatively portable. However, its current ergonomics requires a big
        enough screen and a mouse.</p>

    <p>The adaptation of BALTEK to smartphone is foreseen in another phase.</p>
