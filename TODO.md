# Tasks

1. Study other possible license than "Creative Commons license" such as "GNU General Public License" and "GNU Free Documentation License". Indeed, CC does not recommend using CC for software. Hints: Keep CC-BY-SA for the rules and use GPL for the software; this way the rules can be reused independently from the software.
2. Translate rules in Esperanto.
3. Translate rules in Portuguese.
4. Clean the first implementation of BALTEK mode "two close players".
5. Write unit tests using QUnit.
6. Update "Design.md".
7. Automate a "release" using Python (collecting and minifying released files, ...).
8. Describe the file tree in the README.md file.
